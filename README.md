# Future Plans

~~Course Result (Done)~~

# Known Bugs / Side Notes
For Doubles, the CHART FILTER needs to switch to DOUBLES for the result screen to display what option has been used properly (due to using `DST_OPTION 10` for switching display modes).  
To avoid bugs on `DST_OPTION 330`, this skin is NOT using `#FLIPXXX` commands for switching sides.  
Please change sides manually if you want to change sides.  
LR2OOL extensions are mostly unsupported in BATTLE mode due to lack of extended digit definitions for 2P side.

# Will this port to beatoraja / LVF when everything's done?
LVF port is being considered while beatoraja is currently unplanned due to the dev can't do LUAs.  
You can fork this repository if you want to do a beatoraja port.

# Why are you using a skin with an image illegally extracted from beatmania IIDX 20 tricoro?
Bruh.

# For making / porting FC Effects...
1. Make a folder and name it whatever you want.  
2. Use "SP.csv" for SP, "DP.csv" for DP, and "B.csv", "BR.csv" for different sides in BATTLE mode.
Notice that "SP.csv" should contain both sides.
3. All of the texture files should be concentrated to 2 texture files named "main.pngâ€œ (gr=19) and "sub.png" (gr=18).
4. Make your own effects and send them either via email or pull requests.

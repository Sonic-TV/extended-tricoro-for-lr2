# Requirements
To make everything work, the latest revision of LR2OOL is required.  
Grab it here: https://github.com/tenaibms/LR2OOL  
Base program must be F / S patch applied, with latest revision.

# Future Plans
Native 5 and 9 Key Support  
Course Result

# Known Bugs / Side Notes
For Doubles, the CHART FILTER needs to switch to DOUBLES for the result screen to properly display what option has been used.
(due to using `DST_OPTION 10` for switching display modes).
To avoid bugs on `DST_OPTION 330`, `#FLIPRESULT` is not supported.  
Please change sides manually if you want to change playsides.

# Will this port to beatoraja / LVF when everything's done?
LVF port is being considered while beatoraja is currently unplanned due to the dev can't do LUAs.
You can fork this repository if you want to do a beatoraja port.

# Why are you using a skin with an image illegally extracted from beatmania IIDX 20 tricoro?
Bruh.
